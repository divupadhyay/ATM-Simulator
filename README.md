ATM- SIMULATOR

Description:
This project is an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulator implemented in Java. An ATM simulator mimics the functionalities of a real ATM machine, allowing users to perform basic banking operations such as withdrawing cash, depositing funds, checking balances, and transferring money between accounts.

Features:
1. User Authentication: Authenticate users with a username and PIN (Personal Identification Number) to access their accounts securely.
2. Account Operations: Allow users to perform various account operations, including:
   - Cash Withdrawal: Withdraw money from the account.
   - Cash Deposit: Deposit money into the account.
   - Balance Inquiry: Check the account balance.
   - Transfer Funds: Transfer money between accounts.
3. Transaction Logging: Record all transactions performed by users for auditing purposes.
4. Security Measures: Implement security measures such as encryption for sensitive data and timeout sessions to ensure the safety of user information.
5. User Interface: Provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the ATM system, guiding users through each step of the transaction process.
6. Error Handling: Handle edge cases and errors gracefully, providing informative messages to users in case of invalid inputs or transaction failures.

This project aims to provide a realistic simulation of an ATM system, allowing users to understand the underlying mechanisms of banking operations and practice using an ATM interface in a controlled environment.

Instructions:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java source files using a Java compiler.
3. Run the compiled program to start the ATM simulator.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the ATM interface.
5. Enter your username and PIN to access your account.
6. Select the desired operation (withdrawal, deposit, balance inquiry, transfer funds) and follow the prompts to complete the transaction.
7. Logout securely after completing your transactions.
